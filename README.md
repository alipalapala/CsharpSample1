They gave me a solution and requested to extend and cover some additional scenarios by using BDD practice.
You can run the code with some local changes ,nothing more.
So I added additional classes seen below;

Under "Pages" folder
 -> ExpediaPage.cs
 -> GooglePage.cs

Under "Steps" folder
 -> Expedia.cs
 -> Google.cs

Under "Features" folder
-> Assessment_1
  -> Google.feaure
